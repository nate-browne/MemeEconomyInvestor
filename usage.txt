INVESTOR BOT

##################################################################
How to use (manual running)
##################################################################

First, when you are adding a bot to the `bots.tsv` file, make sure to create an
application on reddit for them. To do that:

1) log in
2) go to reddit.com/prefs/apps
3) create an app
4) change to "personal use script"
5) put whatever you want for the name, set the redirect uri to "http://localhost:8080"
6) copy the client id (the small thing beneath the name on the next page), the
client secret (should be labeled), and make up a user agent and put them in the
corresponding columns of bots.tsv separated BY TABS

Run from the command line by either typing
    (nohup) ./final.py -f files/<filename>.tsv --no-logging &
    OR
    (nohup) ./final.py -f files/<filename>.tsv --no-logging


The top command is put into the background, the bottom isn't. Use the bottom to
be able to stop the program more easily for debugging. Be warned, the purpose
of `nohup` is that it can run even when you ssh off of the pi, so it's not too
useful if you're gonna be around the computer when it's on.

To end the program if it is running in the foreground, type CTRL + C. If it's in the background, type
`ps` to get the running processes, find the PID for the python script (you should see the name),
then type `kill -s SIGINT <PID>`
If something doesn't work, let me know.

How to use (cronjob)
##################################################################

The cronjobs run the two bash scripts you see on a 4 hour sequence.
Starting at midnight every day, the `run.sh` script is run. It gets killed 4 hours
later by `kill.sh`, then it start again 1 minute later and this cycle repeats
all day.

To use this script in cronjobs on multiple computers simultaneously,
open up `run.sh` and change line 25 where it says "bots0.tsv" to be one of the
other .tsv files for the bots. Options are `bots0.tsv`, `bots1.tsv`, and `bots2.tsv`
