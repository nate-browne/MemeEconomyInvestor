INVESTOR BOT

How to use
##################################################################

Run from the command line by either typing
    nohup ./final.py -f <filename>.tsv & (or without nohup)
  OR
    ./final.py -n <number of bots to use>

The top command is put into the background, the bottom isn't. Use the bottom to
be able to debug/see what is going on with the program. Be warned, the purpose
of `nohup` is that it can run even when you ssh off of the pi, so it's not too
useful if you're gonna be around the computer when it's on.

To end the program if it is running in the foreground, type CTRL + C. If it's in the background, type
`ps` to get the running processes, find the PID for the python script (you should see the name),
then type `kill -s SIGINT <PID>`
If something doesn't work, let me know.
